		<H4>Week 9 - Placard and Build Video Script</H4>
		
		Our BME280 temperature sensor was not working as intended so we needed to cut the trace near IC1 as shown in this diagram<br/>

		Also finished drawing up the script for build video. <br/>
		
		It will consist of:<br/>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>2 second Title Screen</li>
		  <li>5 second unboxing and intro to parts</li>
		  <li>5 second Assembly</li>
		  <li>4 second Powering up</li>
		  <li>2 second Protoype video of Lumi</li>
		  <li>3 second Fingerprint reader description</li>
		  <li>3 second Neopixel ring description</li>
		  <li>3 second Microphone description</li>
		  <li>3 second Proximity description</li>
		</ul>
		
		Total duration of video is approximately 30 seconds.<br/>

	<H4>Week 8 - PCB Testing </H4>
	Powered up the Raspberry Pi 3 for the first time with the image file.
	
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XQpZRvO.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:400px;height:500px;"><br />
	
	Opened the terminal and ran this block of code
	
	git clone https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat.git
	cd StudentSenseHat/firmware
	gcc -Wall -o traffic2B traffic2B.c -lwiringPi
	sudo ./traffic2B
	
	There was a loop in the C code that caused the LED on my PCB board to flash from Green to Red. 
	Pretty cool!
	
	Then I ran this small block of code
	
	make
	sudo ./ghmain
	
	and got this<br/>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfdkhLG.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:400px;height:500px;"><br />
	
	In tandem with the light sensor, I can get light readings on the terminal at 1 second intervals.
	
	Tested by covering the sensor with my hand and shining a flashflight to achieve both ends of the spectrum.
	
	Changed the system date to the current date using
	
	sudo date -s "1 DEC 2017 13:00:00"
	
	Modified code for Enterprise Wi-Fi in the paths /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	
	Downloaded the Humber Certificate.
	
	Good to go!
